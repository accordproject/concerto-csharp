## Introduction

This is a prototype implementation of the [Concerto Schema Language](https://docs.accordproject.org/docs/model-concerto.html) for .NET written in C#. The current [reference implementation](https://github.com/accordproject/concerto) is written in JavaScript.

This repository contains:
- Serialization and Deserialization utilities for `System.Text.Json` and `Newtonsoft.Json`.

## Basic Usage

```csharp
using System.Text.Json;
using System.Text.Json.Serialization;
using Concerto.Serialization;
using Concerto.Models.org.test;
 
//...

    JsonSerializerOptions options = new()
    {
        DefaultIgnoreCondition = JsonIgnoreCondition.WhenWritingNull,
        Converters =
        {
            new JsonStringEnumConverter(),
            new ConcertoConverter(),
        }
    };

    Employee employee = new Employee()
    {
        firstName = "Matt",
        lastName = "Roberts",
        email = "test@example.com",
        _identifier = "test@example.com",
        department = Department.ENGINEERING,
        employeeId = "123"
    };

    string jsonString = JsonSerializer.Serialize(employee, options);

    // jsonString contains
    //{
    //     "$class": "org.test.Employee",
    //     "department": "ENGINEERING",
    //     "employeeId": "123",
    //     "email": "test@example.com",
    //     "firstName": "Matt",
    //     "lastName": "Roberts",
    //     "$identifier": "test@example.com"
    // }
  
```

> This repository uses statically built versions of the internal `Concerto.Models.concerto` and `Concerto.Models.concerto.metamodel` namespaces. In the future this should be build dynamically using the Concerto CLI. There is an [open branch with the changes needed to `concerto-tools` package](https://github.com/mttrbrts/composer-concerto/blob/mr-csharp-newtonsoft/packages/concerto-tools/lib/codegen/fromcto/csharp/csharpvisitor.js). You can build the C# classes from the Concerto source files (`.cto`) will the following command:
>
> `concerto compile --model ./models/concerto.metamodel.cto --model ./models/employee.cto --target csharp --output ./`

## Running Tests

```sh
  $ cd ConcertoJsonConverter.Tests
  $ dotnet restore
  $ dotnet build --configuration Release --no-restore
  $ dotnet test --no-restore --verbosity normal
```

## Limitations

Support for polymorphic deserialization & serialization is limited in the popular C# JSON libraries. We provide an exemplar Converter for both, each has different limitations.

### System.Text.Json

System.Text.Json does not have any support for Polymorphic deserialization or serialization, so we provide our own implementation. The current implementation cannot inherit the default behaviour for `JsonSerializerOptions`. We attempt to mirror the basic features needed for Concerto (such as `NullHandling` and `JsonProperty` annotations), however other features are not supported.

### Newtonsoft JSON.net

Newtonsoft does support basic polymorphic deserialization, however, it doesn't not support support deserialization to a supertype (see `SimpleObject_DeserializeToSuperType_Succeeds` in [./ConcertoJsonConverter.Tests/newtonsoft/Deserialize.cs](ConcertoJsonConverter.Tests/newtonsoft/Deserialize.cs)).
